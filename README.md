## Preamble

We can divide the job search into several stages:

1. Planning;
2. Market Analysis;
3. CV (resume) writing;
4. Getting responses;
5. Going to interviews;
6. Failure analysis;
7. Gathering feedback;
8. Accepting the offer.

But before you start looking for your dream job and the right company, you need to think about your future career path. This is the stage where your professional journey and development begins. In this lesson, you'll learn all the steps you need to take before writing a resume.

In this project, you'll learn how to
- Define your values;
- Set goals and plan your career.

By working on this project, you will learn how to
- How to articulate your professional values, which will directly influence your choice of future company and job;
- How to set and specify goals that will help you build a career path.

## Chapter II

## General rules

1. Along the way, you'll feel a sense of uncertainty and a severe lack of information. Don't worry: this is perfectly normal. Remember, the information in the repository and on Google is always with you, as are your peers and Rocket.Chat. Communicate, search, use common sense, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.
2. Pay attention to information sources: check, think, analyze, compare.
3. Pay close attention to the text of the assignment, read it several times.
4. Read the examples carefully. There may be something in them that is not explicitly stated in the assignment itself.
5. You may encounter inconsistencies when something new in a condition or example contradicts something you already know. If you come across something like this, try to figure it out. If you can't, put it in the list of open questions and you'll find the answer as you go. Don't leave any open questions unanswered.
6. If a task seems incomprehensible or impossible, remember that it isn't: you're just seeing it that way. Try to deconstruct it, and certain parts will become clear.
7. You'll encounter various tasks along the way. Those marked with an asterisk (\*) are for the most meticulous and curious students. These tasks are more difficult and optional, but they'll help you gain additional experience and knowledge.
8. Don't try to cheat the system or the people around you. After all, you're only fooling yourself.
9. Got a question? Ask your peers.
10. When you ask someone for help, always make sure you understand why, how, and for what purpose. Otherwise, the help won't help you.
11. Always _push_ only to the _develop_ branch! The _master_ branch is ignored. Work in the _src_ directory.
12. There should be no files in your directory other than those specified in the tasks.

## Chapter III

## The wheel of career priorities

If you don't understand what you want from your job, the search can drag on for a very long time. This exercise will help you understand what to look for in a company and in a job opening. Once you have a clear understanding, you'll be able to navigate the job market and choose the job of your dreams.

Your job search begins with goal setting and planning. Before you start looking for a job, you can create a career wheel with your job search criteria:

![–ö–æ–ª–µ—Å–∞ –∫–∞—Ä—å–µ—Ä–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—Ä–∏–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ—Ç–æ–≤](misc/images/CT00.1.png)

**What might these criteria be?**
- Ability to work remotely;
- Desired salary range;
- Health insurance/benefits;
- Friendly team, etc.

The criteria must be determined by you and you alone. You need to rate (on a 10-point scale) where you are now and where you want to be.

_Why do it?_ To see where you want your career to go, what you'd like to improve, and what steps you need to take to get there. Prioritizing will help you build your resume, select companies, and interview later in your career. Employers look for and recognize candidates who know exactly what they want. When you're choosing between job offers, you can always refer back to your priorities and make the right choice.

## Setting career goal

Career goal setting helps you break down your overall goal and accelerate your progress toward it. It's possible to have a goal that sounds like "I want to become a lead programmer," but if you don't understand how to get there and don't break it down into steps and analyze what you need to do to get there, such a goal becomes meaningless. There are several techniques for goal setting. You can use them not only in your career, but also in your life.

For example, there are many different career planning and goal setting techniques that you can use:

**GROW by John Whitmore:**

- **Goal** ‚Äî What is your goal? What do you want to accomplish?
- **Reality** ‚Äî What is your current situation?
- **Options** ‚Äî What are your options for reaching your goal? Who can help you? What do you want? You need to brainstorm some ideas.
- **Will** ‚Äî What do you need to do to achieve the goal? What are the next steps? When would you take them?

For example:

| Goal | Reality | Options | Will |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To become a CTO in a startup in 5 years and earn 4,000 - 4,500 USD. | Now I'm a student at School 21. I know JS and use React library. I have a relatively small student portfolio. | \- Complete the training to the end.<br /> \- Get a job first in a large company to work with a mentor/manager so I can learn from experience<br /> \- Possibly receive additional training in team management<br /> \- Constantly improve my skills<br /> \- Build a portfolio<br /> \- Solve algorithms | 1. Complete the training<br /> 2. Create a resume and prepare a portfolio<br /> 3. Successfully pass an interview and get a job<br /> 4. Work in a team of developers for the first 2-3 years, be initiative and become a team leader<br /> 5. Become a head of the department in 4-5 years, leave for the startup and become CTO |

**SMART**

After deciding on the goal, you need to define your values. Each person has different values that change throughout their life journey. So we can emphasize the following values:

- Autonomy,
- Work-life balance,
- Income,
- Security,
- Innovation (doing innovative projects),
- New experiences (travel, new projects),
- Team Work,
- Society/ecology (being healthy and sustainable),
- Self-expression/creativity, etc.

Read more about ["Smart"](https://in-scale.ru/blog/celi-smart/).

Understanding your values will help you decide on a list of companies that are the best fit for you and that you want to pursue.

You can take a [Personal Values Assessment Test](https://onlinetestpad.com/ru/test/74311-test-cennosti-shvarca).

We advise you to divide the career goal into two periods to have a clear understanding of your career path and direction:

1. The first reference point "A" is today.
2. The second point "B" is your career goal for 5 years ahead.
 Planning a career beyond 5 years is difficult because the world is changing rapidly now, some professions are dying out and others are being automated, so it's important to follow your direction, develop your skills and stay on track.
3. The intermediate point between "A" and "B" is 2-3 years.

| Today (point A) | 2-3 years | Career goal (point B)<br />5 years |
| --- | --- | --- |
| At this point, you describe:<br /> \- Your current career status<br /> \- Skills and knowledge you possess<br /> \- Resources available for development | You will fill in this column later, after completing exercises on job analytics and identifying your strengths. Then you will need to write down the action plan that you will be ready to implement to achieve your career goal. | Describe the desired position that you want to take up in 5 years, for example:<br />*CTO in an educational startup working remotely with a team of 4-5 developers and a salary of 4,500 USD with benefits*.<br />For each period, you can use the SMART or GROW methodology. |

You can draw the final career plan in MIRO. This platform provides a handy way to break up time periods and add necessary updates to your individual career track. It is preferable to develop a step-by-step career plan that includes:

1. Skills you currently possess;
2. Skills you lack to achieve a career goal;
3. Decisions about how to acquire specific skills (find a mentor, take a course, get a peer review, etc.);
4. Break down your career plan to think 2-3 and 4-5 years ahead. Don't forget to review your career progress every year.

## Chapter IV

## Task

To accomplish this task, you need to map out your career path for the next 3-5 years. To do this, you need to understand your career goals, define your values, and create a step-by-step plan.

## Chapter V

## Exercise 00

### The Career Balance Wheel

1. Write down at least five job selection criteria and rate the status of these criteria on a scale of 1 to 10.
2. Make a second wheel with the same criteria and rate them again from 1 to 10 to show how you would like these criteria to be in the future.
3. For each criterion, think of and write down the action steps to show what you'll do to get to the desired state. We recommend performing this task using MIRO or a similar tool. Please upload a visualization of the final wheel (2 pieces) to the _src_ folder.

## Exercise 01

### Career Goals

1. Make a chart of your career goals for 1-2 years and 4-5 years.
2. In the first column, describe your current career status.
3. In the third column, write where you want to be in 5 years and what is important to you in your job. Your answers should be based on your values and your career balance wheel.
4. Leave the second column blank for now.
